* A resonable person knows that speed of a car is one of the key parameters from the car getting stopped. Let's find out how accelaration or deceleration in speed impacts the vehicle from stopping or not using [Linear Regression](https://github.com/cdevairakkam7/Statistical-Modelling-/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb). 

* Will this person churn or not? Questions like this need a yes or no answer. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/cdevairakkam7/Statistical-Modelling-/blob/master/logistic%20regression.ipynb) can get that answer for us.
