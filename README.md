* Let's find out how accelaration or deceleration in speed impacts the vehicle from stopping  using [Linear Regression](https://github.com/cdevairakkam7/Statistical-Modelling-/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb). 

* Will a student get admitted into a  university ? Questions like this need a yes or no answer. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/cdevairakkam7/Statistical-Modelling-/blob/master/logistic%20regression.ipynb) can get that answer for us.

* Let us try to predict the salary using [Random Forest](https://github.com/cdevairakkam7/Statistical-Modelling-/blob/master/Random%20Forest.ipynb).
